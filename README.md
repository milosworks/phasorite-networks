## About

Phasorite Networks is a modern (WIP, Alpha) mod for transferring energy wirelessly.

### Networks

**The base of Phasorite Networks are, well, networks!**

Networks are fully customizable, with the ability to scale across various dimensions, you can manage and see the
throughput of energy across the network.
Using a network reduces the lag that a huge **cable** network could cause, also reducing the time for building the
infrastructure for the cables.

### Component Screen

In the component screen (component being an Exporter or Importer) you can configure its properties, this being:

- Name
- Energy Limit Per Tick
- Priority
- Override Mode (It will always be prioritized first)
- Limitless Mode (Will ignore the set limit)

### Networks Screen

Create and manage your and others networks

- Use a color picker to choose the color of your network!
- Set your network to a specific visibility!
    - Private
    - Public
    - Public with Password (Only people with the password can join)

### Extra Screens

When connected to a network you have access to extra "tabs"

- Statistics Tab: See the global statistic of energy going into/out the network
- Components Tab: See specifically what components are connected into your network and how much energy they are
  importing/exporting into/from the network
- Members Tab: See the players connected to your network
