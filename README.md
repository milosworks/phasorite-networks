## About

Phasorite Networks is a modern (WIP, Alpha) mod for transferring energy wirelessly.

### Networks

**The base of phasorite networks are, well, networks!**

Networks are fully customizable, with the ability to scale across various dimensions, you can manage and see the
throughput of energy across the network.
Using a network reduces the lag that a huge **cable** network could cause, also reducing the time for building the
infrastructure for the cables.

#### Phasorite Importer

The phasorite importer is probably the first component you'll need to craft, this component receives energy to transfer
it to all the exporters in the network.

#### Phasorite Exporter

The phasorite exporter is the second component you'll craft, this component exports the energy that the importers
received.

### Resources

You need resources to make the components, these resources are craftable or obtainable in the world.

#### Budding Phasorite

The Budding Phasorite will be your best friend, its made by using a [Phasorite Seed](#phasorite-seed) on a Budding
Amethyst.
It produces [Phasorite Clusters](#phasorite-clusters-and-buds), these clusters when fully grown will give you Phasorite
Crystals or Charged Phasorite Crystals

#### Phasorite Clusters And Buds

These are the phasorite clusters and buds.
Small Bud, Medium Bud, Large Bud, Phasorite Cluster and Charged Phasorite Cluster (From left to right, charged clusters
have an animation).

Each bud will give you Phasorite Dust, the Phasorite Cluster gives you Phasorite Crystals, the Charged Phasorite Cluster
gives Charged Phasorite Crystals, the clusters also give some Phasorite Dust.

To grow the Charged Phasorite Clusters, these will need to be on direct sunlight.

#### Other Materials

These materials are just craftable and needed to make components, etc.

#### Phasorite Core

Needed in every component.
